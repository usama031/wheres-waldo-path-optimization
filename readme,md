# Where's Waldo: Path Optimization 🕵️‍♂️🧠

This project explores how optimization algorithms can be applied to solve a fun and challenging problem: **finding the shortest path to Waldo** in a cluttered and visually complex image. By treating the search for Waldo as a pathfinding and scanning problem, we simulate and optimize a strategy to traverse the image most efficiently.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To develop a method that simulates how a person might visually scan a **"Where’s Waldo"** image and apply **path optimization algorithms** (like TSP or greedy search) to reduce the total area scanned before finding Waldo.
